    "answer"  : "Again, just like the personal accounts, we do not currently have a dashboard for our partners either. But, our users and our partners come first. This is why we are currently building out a dashboard for our partners to see their account information whenever they want it."

    "question": "As a business, how do we sign up to have an account and offer discounts on Passenger?",
    "answer"  : "In the coming months we are going to be releasing our partners dashboard which will allow them to sign up for an account and see all of the information that they could ever want for their account. But, for now, just by simply emailing us we will respond to you in less than 24 hours with a phone call to get going with creating you an account on Passenger."
