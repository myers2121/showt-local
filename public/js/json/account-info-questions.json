    "question": "How can I access my account?",
    "answer"  : "Enter the section of the app title \"me.\" from there you'll be able to find a whole hell of a lot of cool shit about yourself, including but not limited to your name and a neat picture of you as well as some settings like what your name is and the picture of you that you want to put up on there."

    "question": "Where do babies come from?",
    "answer"  : "If you honestly came to this website to ask that question then you will probably never know first hand quite how it happens. I want you to do me a favor, and hit the back button located in the top left corner of your browser, and never visit this website again. Thank you."

    "question": "What came first the chicken or the egg?",
    "answer"  : "The chicken came first. Think about it. What is so special about an egg? They're shaped weird and they are very fragile. That would make them simply incompatible with the early world. If I were a dinosaur and I found an egg I would smash that egg in my gigantic and ferocious jaws. I would enslave the chicken, though, and that's what makes me think the chicken had to come first. I mean honestly, do you think that a chicken is less apt for survival when compared to a goddamn egg? Here's what you should do. Find an egg. Look at it, and then throw that egg on the floor. It will shatter like the argument that the egg came first. Now do the same thing to the chicken. You can't! That chicken would claw you up so quick!"
